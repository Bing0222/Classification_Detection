# Classification_Detection

## This Repository is focused on Classification and Detection projects 
Generally, classification and detection have some common steps to assemble them.  
*Classification generally is pre-step of Detection and Segmentation*  
*About Segmentation putting on the Segmentation Repository*

### This Repository saves some detection projects and some knowledge (Faster R-CNN,SSD, YOLO)  
### This Repository also saves some classification (Brids,CatandDog, Cifar10)
